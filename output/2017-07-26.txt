I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with Mine eye.	(Psalm 32:8)

THE GUIDANCE OF GOD (1)

Now we are often like the horse, or the mule (v. 9), every one of us—and this, because our souls have not been plowed up. When there is anything in which the will of man is at work, the Lord deals with us, as with the horse or the mule, holding us in. When every part of the heart is in contact with Himself, He guides us with His “eye.”

“The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness” (Lk. 11:34). When there is anything wherein the eye is not single, so long as this is the case, there is not free communion in heart and affections with God; and the consequence is, our will not being subdued, we are not led simply of God. When the heart is in a right state, the whole body is “full of light,” and there is the quick perception of the will of God. He just teaches us by His eye all that He wishes, and produces in us quickness of understanding in His fear (Isa. 11:3). This is our portion, as having the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, being “quick of understanding in the fear of Jehovah,” hearts without any object, save the will and glory of God. And that is just what Christ was: “Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me. I delight to do thy will” (Ps. 40:7-8). Where there is this, the circumstances of the path may be bitter and painful, but there will be in it the joy of obedience. There is always joy, and the consequence is God guiding us by His eye. But the Lord deals morally, and will not let me find out His way, unless there be in me the spirit of obedience. This is precisely the obedience of faith. The heart must be in the condition of obedience, as Christ’s was.
